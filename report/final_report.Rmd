\begin{abstract}

  This report describes a novel implementation of an autonomous agent
  for bilateral negotiation using a DANS opponent model and
  optimized acceptance criteria.

\end{abstract}

# Introduction

Multi-agent negotiation is a task for artificially intelligent and
autonomous systems that involves consensus decision-making. This report
focuses on bilateral negotiations between two agents supporting SOAP,
the Stacked Alternating Offers Protocol [@soap].

# Design

Our agent's goal is to optimize its own utility. To do this, it must
make competitive bids and concede minimally, finding the highest-utility
bid that the opponent will also accept. A key part of this is
identifying the opponent's strategy.

To accomplish this, our agent is designed around two modules: the
opponent model and the bidding and acceptance strategy. The opponent
model, with access to both agents' bid history, performs a DANS analysis
in each time step to produce a behavior verdict for each bid. The
time-series history of DANS verdicts is then used in the bidding and
acceptance strategy to decide on the best next action, such as by
judging the dominant characteristic of the opponent.

## DANS

In summary, DANS analysis employed by the agent is a data-driven
approach that uses the change in bid to identify opponent behavior.

The process assigns a category verdict to each bid based on the current
and previous time step. In doing this, DANS considers only the
opponent's offers. It uses the following two values:

-   $\Delta m$ for change in the agent's utility $m$

-   $\Delta o$ for change in the opponent agent's predicted utility $o$

The first of the prerequisite values, $m$, is trivially available to the
agent. The opponent agent's predicted utility $o$ is determined using
through statistical estimation. The `IssueEstimator` and
`ValueEstimator` classes are part of the `TemplateAgent` development
suite for ANAC 2023, and their functionality will not be discussed here
in detail.

The five classes produced are $\text{FORTUNATE}$, $\text{UNFORTUNATE}$,
$\text{SELFISH}$, $\text{NICE}$, and $\text{SILENT}$. The thresholds
that inform category selection used were taken from @eli-dans.

## Acceptance criteria

# Implementation

The agent was implemented in Python 3.9 and is fully compatible with the
GeniusWeb capabilities in use for the Automated Negotiating Agents
Competition (ANAC) 2023 and Automated Negotiation League (ANL) 2023. All
contributions by the authors of this report are extensions of the
`TemplateAgent` package in the ANL 2023 example agent repository[^1] by
Bram Renting and collaborators. This section describes the structure of
our implementation and corresponding methods in the source code.

## Implementation of the DANS model

Put a description and list of methods here...

# Optimization

The implementation of our agent includes 'tuning' parameters. We
leverage Bayesian optimization to find an optimum value for each
parameter based on testing with a set of known agents.

# Evaluation

The final stage of our optimization procedure is the source of data for
our evaluation. We run the agent against a cross product of 50 test
agents and 5 randomly selected preference domains. The data that results
from this testing is discussed in this chapter as an indicator of our
agent's performance and limitations.

## Performance against other agents

The data should indicate that we perform well for individual utility
against a variety of opponent agents.

## Limitations

### Learning agents

The data suggests good performance in one-shot learning agents. However,
the evaluation does not consider advanced learning agents that could
presumably gain an advantage over a number of 'training' runs against
our implementation.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, we have shown that a DANS-based opponent model is a
viable strategy for autonomous negotiation.

# Ethical Statement {.unnumbered}

While there are no ethical issues with the design and implementation of
our autonomous agent, @agent-ethics writes that such issues may arise
when self-serving negotiation agents such as ours are applied in
sensitive contexts.
