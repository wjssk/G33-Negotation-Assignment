\begin{abstract}

  This report describes a novel implementation of an autonomous agent
  for bilateral negotiation using a DANS opponent model and
  optimized acceptance criteria.

\end{abstract}

# Introduction

Multi-agent negotiation is a task for artificially intelligent and
autonomous systems that involves consensus decision-making. This report
focuses on bilateral negotiations between two agents supporting the SOAP
protocol.

The GeniusWeb framework is a playground for bilateral agent negotiation.

# Design

Our agent's goal is to optimize its own utility. To do this, it must
make competitive bids and concede minimally, finding the highest-utility
bid that the opponent will also accept. A key part of this is
identifying the opponent's strategy.

To accomplish this, our agent is designed to use two separate modules:
the opponent model and the bidding and acceptance strategy. The opponent
model, with access to both agents' bid history, performs a DANS analysis
in each time step to produce a behavior verdict for each bid. The
time-series history of DANS verdicts is then used in the bidding and
acceptance strategy to decide on the best next action, such as by
judging the dominant characteristic of the opponent.

## DANS

In summary, DANS analysis employed by the agent is a data-driven
approach that uses the change in bid to identify opponent behavior.

The process assigns a category verdict to each bid based on the current
and previous time step. In doing this, DANS considers only the
opponent's offers. It uses the following two values:

-   $\Delta m$ for change in the agent's utility $m$

-   $\Delta o$ for change in the opponent agent's predicted utility $o$

The first of the prerequisite values, $m$, is trivially available to the
agent. The opponent agent's predicted utility $o$ is determined using
through statistical estimation. The `IssueEstimator` and
`ValueEstimator` classes are part of the `TemplateAgent` development
suite for ANAC 2023, and their functionality will not be discussed here
in detail.

The five classes produced are $\text{FORTUNATE}$, $\text{UNFORTUNATE}$,
$\text{SELFISH}$, $\text{NICE}$, and $\text{SILENT}$. The thresholds
that inform category selection used were taken from @eli-dans.

# Conclusion

# Ethical Statement {.unnumbered}

While there are no ethical issues with the design and implementation of
our autonomous agent, @agent-ethics writes that such issues may arise
when self-serving negotiation agents such as ours are applied in
sensitive contexts.
